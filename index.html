          <p>
            my name is Ethan.
            i do code stuff.
            i also (used to) tutor for <a href="https://001gamecreator.com">001 Game Creator</a> sometimes.
            not doing it right now because currently most of my time is spent in class.
            outside of class, i'm probably working on a prototype game engine.
          </p>

            i might use various websites at various times. here are links. this list is not guaranteed to be comprehensive.
            <ul>
              <li><a rel="me" href="https://mas.to/@sgolc">Mastodon</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgD0QPP9Na7x9JehjRKSJiA">Youtube</a></li>

          <h2 id="books">The Literacy Zone</h2>
          <p>
            I'm trying to read more (when I'm not swamped with classwork, that is) so I might list
            some books I'm reading here sometime.
            Finished Mark Z. Danielewski's <cite>House of Leaves</cite> as well as Amitav Ghosh's <cite>Gun Island</cite> semi-recently.
            Planning to read David Graeber's <cite>Bull Shit Jobs</cite> and Naomi Klein's <cite>The Shock Doctrine</cite> in the near future.
          </p>
          <h2 id="articles">Beyond Literacy</h2>
          <p>
            I also write articles once in a blue moon. Someday I'll put together a page that automatically generates a list of them all, but for now there's only really two worth reading:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a href="./articles/house_of_leaves.html">My Thoughts on House of Leaves</a>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="./articles/vogel.html">Video Games Will Destroy the World (a response to an article by Jeff Vogel)</a>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you'd like to know when (or if) I publish any future articles, I now have an Atom feed!
            <a href="./articles/feed.xml" type="application/atom+xml" rel="alternate">Here's the link!</a>
          </p>
