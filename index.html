          <p>
            my name is Ethan.
            i do code stuff.
            i also tutor for <a href="https://001gamecreator.com">001 Game Creator</a> sometimes.
            currently most of my time is spent in class.
            outside of class, i'm probably working on a prototype game engine.
            mostly thinking about software rendering in a functional paradigm at the moment.

          <h2 id="books">The Literacy Zone</h2>
          <p>
            I'm trying to read more (when I'm not swamped with classwork, that is) so I might list
            some books I'm reading here sometime.
            Recently finished Mark Z. Danielewski's <cite>House of Leaves</cite> as well as Amitav Ghosh's <cite>Gun Island</cite> semi-recently.
            Planning to read David Graeber's <cite>Bull Shit Jobs</cite> and Naomi Klein's <cite>The Shock Doctrine</cite> in the near future.
          </p>
          <h2 id="articles">Beyond Literacy</h2>
          <p>
            I also write articles once in a blue moon. Someday I'll put together a page that automatically generates a list of them all, but for now there's only really two worth reading:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a href="./articles/house_of_leaves.html">My Thoughts on House of Leaves</a>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="./articles/vogel.html">Video Games Will Destroy the World (a response to an article by Jeff Vogel)</a>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
