	  <p>
	    Have you ever stepped into a public restroom and found
	    yourself gawking? Graffiti on stall walls, suspicious stains,
	    paper strewn across the seat. Or maybe something more positive:
	    helpful accessibility features, better-than-average privacy,
	    water-saving toilets.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    I want to visualize the state of public restrooms in Muncie.
	    To do so, I need your help. I'm looking for photos. They don't
	    need to be terribly professional, or depict any one thing
	    in particular. If you use a public restroom and something
	    about it catches your attention, share it! If you have a particular
	    opinion on or issue with restrooms that you want to voice, share it!
	    If you've heard a rumor, remember some bit of history about,
	    or had an unusual experience with a particular toilet, share it!
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Below are two pictures I took around the Ball State campus to
	    give a sense of what I'm looking for. Don't restrict
	    yourself to mimicing me, though! Every photo helps to paint a more
	    complete picture, mundane as it may be.

		Despite having "public" in the name, there is a certain
		expectation of privacy in public restrooms.
