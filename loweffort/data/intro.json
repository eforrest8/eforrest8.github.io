    "text": "<p>So here&#39;s my cool blog thing. It retrieves data dynamically using XmlHttpRequest, which means there&#39;s basically some weird proto-CMS stuff going on. Or maybe not, I have no idea what I&#39;m talking about.</p><p>Anyhow, this blog isn&#39;t about my l33t javascript skillz. I&#39;ve been sitting around lately, unable to motivate myself to do pretty much anything at all. Not a great time. So I think to myself, &quot;Maybe what I need is to consistently write about what I&#39;m doing in a public format! That&#39;ll surely motivate me to get something done!&quot;</p><p>Also, I feel like I have a really hard time communicating my thoughts to other people. So maybe this will help?</p><p>My plan is to write an article of some sort every weekend (or maybe more often if things happen????) until I either decide it&#39;s not helping or contract scurvy and die.</p><p>Fortunately, I haven&#39;t died yet. Hooray!</p><h3>So what am I gonna write about?</h3><p>I dunno. I kinda wanna make a weird Castlevania clone, so maybe I&#39;ll start with that. Or maybe I&#39;ll give up and write about wrestling or vhs digitization or some other thing I don&#39;t know anything about. I dunno.</p><p>Anywho, I think that&#39;s enough for a first post. I&#39;ll post something else next weekend probably no promises.</p>"
